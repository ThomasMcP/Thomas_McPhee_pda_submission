# should be def not dif
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  # more than one object needs to be separated by a comma
  #if statement should be nested within function
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card #should say card1
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end # this end is not needed.

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  #total is given no value.
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
    # returns too early. Should return after loop
    # total needs to be converted to a string for this to work.
